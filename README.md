# Anime4K_pytorchvision
This is [Anime4K](https://bloc97.github.io/Anime4K/), but a version rewritten in pytorch. 

(For some mysterious power of laziness) we only download the smallest part of the "smaller datasets" from full dataset for training.
This is the [full dataset](https://github.com/bloc97/SYNLA-Plus/releases) of original project.

## Acknowledgements:
Without K024's help from start to finish, this project would not exist (physically).
